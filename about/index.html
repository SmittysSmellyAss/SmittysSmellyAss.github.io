        <p>They call me an angel, but I ain't one. I'm a developer.
        Those homeless guys on the street, they got stories, sad ones, but stories.</p> So I gave them a job, holdin' signs that says PoschPlus.
        Win-win, right? They get some cash, and I get free advertisement.</p> Plus, it makes me look good, you know, like a hero.
        Everyone's happy. Especially me. This name of this man is Jack Hartley.</p>
        <p> Yesterday he was smoking amphetamines and today he works for me. Today he is part of my street based marketing network.</p> Go PoschPlus! I help the homeless. I pay these men $2 an hour and provide 3 meals a week!
